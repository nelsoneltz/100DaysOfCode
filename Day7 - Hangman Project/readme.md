## Project: Hangman

### Objective: Guessing word game

Hangman was a project to revisit and use everything from day 1 to 6. 
The only topic that was not used was Functions. But I can see various micro functions that can be implemented in the code.

### Concepts used:
- Importing modules;
- Creating modules in a .py file
- Using `random.choice` to pick a value from a list;
- I had a little bit of knowledge of list comprehension so I created the blank list with 2 method: List Comprehension and For Loop;
- While Loop to repeat until reach the end game.
- Using conditionals within the While to evaluate the stage of the game (lives);
- Creating string from a list and vice versa;
