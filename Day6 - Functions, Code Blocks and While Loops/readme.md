## Project: Escape the Maze - [Reeborgs](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) Site/Game

### Objective: Create a script that makes the robot escape the maze. ```Hint: Hug the right wall...```

### Concepts:
- Functions: Form of creating custom scripts. 
```python
# Basic Structure

def function():
    print("Fun Function")

function() # Will print on console "Fun Function"
```
- Code Blocks: Identations is a pre-requisite for Python. 4 spaces. The documentation asks to use 4 Spaces and not tab.
```# i'll still be using tab```
- While Loops: Loops while a condition is not met. Differ from the For Loop, which iterate over values of lists and range. Usually While Loops are used in True of False conditionals.
```python
# This will play infinitely
while True:
    print("You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round")
    print("Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round")
```
